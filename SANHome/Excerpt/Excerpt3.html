 <div class="excerpt">
    <div class="exp">
                          There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains
thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages;
each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color.
There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or
prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time
seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of
its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few
axioms.
First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is the
future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind.
Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent
demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical
volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated
librarian, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the
divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols
which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters
inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
