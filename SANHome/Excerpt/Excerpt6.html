                          Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book as
confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines.
He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in
Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was
established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian
inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative
analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition. These
examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental
law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse
they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the
comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which
travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books.
From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and
that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd
orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite):
Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels'
autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands
of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the
demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides,
the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that
gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages,
the interpolations of every book in all books.
