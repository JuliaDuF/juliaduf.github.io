                          For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to
past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians,
used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few
miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is
incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of
inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical
or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the
following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71 was not the
one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague
thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture
has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its
originators.
