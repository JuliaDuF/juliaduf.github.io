 <div class="excerpt">
    <div class="exp">
                          The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and
perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between,
surrounded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see,
interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is
invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except
two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that
of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which
opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and
right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep
standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes
a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances.
In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men
usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this
illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and
promise the infinite... Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the
name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light
they emit is insufficient, incessant.
