                          When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression
was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of
an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose
eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the
universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great
deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy which
vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained
prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet
native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of
finding their Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors,
proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the
deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion
by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad... The Vindications exist (I
have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps
not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man's
finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed
as zero.
