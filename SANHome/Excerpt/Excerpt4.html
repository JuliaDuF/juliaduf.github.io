                          Second: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number.^ This finding
made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the
Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered:
the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw
in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV,
perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in
this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy
pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward
statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and
incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain
and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of
finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm... They admit that
the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain
that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in
themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
