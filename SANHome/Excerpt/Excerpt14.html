                          Translated by J. E. I. <br>
The original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. The punctuation
has been limited to the comma and the period. These two signs, the space and
the twenty-two letters of the alphabet are the twenty-five symbols considered
sufficient by this unknown author. (Editor's note.)

Before, there was a man for every three hexagons. Suicide and pulmonary
diseases have destroyed that proportion. A memory of unspeakable melancholy:
at times I have traveled for many nights through corridors and along polished
stairways without finding a single librarian.

I repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is
excluded. For example: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are
books which discuss and negate and demonstrate this possibility and others
whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.

Letizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously
speaking, a single volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format,
printed in nine or ten point type, containing an infinite number if infinitely thin
leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri said that all solid bodies are
the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handling of this silky
vade mecum would not be convenient: each apparent page would unfold into
other analogous ones; the inconceivable middle page would have no reverse.
